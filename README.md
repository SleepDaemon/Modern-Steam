# Steam Dark Mode
Do you wish that Valve would update the look of steam already, because you're bored of the old look of it. Well look no further Steam Dark Mode got you covered.

# Notice
The bugs mentioned below still exist, and I have tried my best to solve them but unfortantly failed. Also, I will no longer be doing updates on this repo, as I have given up on this project and no longer interested in it. I might do one last update later on where I fix mentioned bugs.

I highly suggest Fluent for Steam as it uses the same sources I use for it's skin, you can find them on Github [here](https://github.com/purogamer/Fluent-for-Steam), or visit their site [fluentforsteam.io](https://www.fluentforsteam.io/)
